> style: dot bullet, content: Who-How-What

- ContractOwner creates a vesting schedule for a specific Beneficiary’s wallet address.
- Both ContractOwner and Beneficiary can release the token being vested, and transfer it to Beneficiary wallet.
- ContractOwner can revoke an existing vesting schedule.

Caution: Contract doesn't support native token such as Ether on Ethereum network.

## Use case

- As a token-sales manager of your project token:
    - This module handles token vesting schedule and token releasing for each stake-holder(e.g. investor).
    - Your project token would be bought by investors over an ico/public sale/seed phase over a period of time that is pre-calculated.
